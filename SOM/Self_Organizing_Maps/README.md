*Self Organising Maps*
---------------------

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction.


Aim of this project is to detect of fraudulant credit card applications by this unsupervised algorithm developed by Giuseppe Vettigli
