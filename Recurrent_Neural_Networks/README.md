*Prediction of stock trends Using Recurrent Neural Networks*
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Using the stock details of google untill 2016 dec, we predict the stock trends of that in 2017 january month.
Here in this RNN we use LSTM layers in the sequential model from keras with tensorflow backend.
